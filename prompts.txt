HIRAGANA PRACTICE APP - CONVERSATION PROMPTS
==============================================

1. Initial Request:
"ok, I want to create a web app from scratch called hiragana (folder created), where all the hiragana characters are shown, one after the next, where a user can draw with either a mouse on desktop or with their finger on mobile to complete the character and then move on to the next. I would like this to deploy to github pages. go wild"

2. First Iteration Feedback:
"very good first iteration. A couple of changes

1. I'd like arrows with numbers showing the order of brush strokes for each character.
2. Currently the page does not fit css wise. I want to ensure there is no scroll on desktop or mobile and also that everything fits nicely (focus on enough space to draw the character.
3. If the character is completed successfully enough you can show a check mark and auto move on to the next one.
4. I want it in a, e, i, o, u order, then the k's etc. Like how the keyboard is layed out on the mobile keyboard
5. Can you add the dakuten etc too please"

3. Deploy Script Update:
"ok, your deploy script is asking for username and password for git. Can it just use my ssh key?"

4. Progress Bar Enhancement:
"I would like to be able to skip to anywhere in the progressbar"

5. Theme System Request:
"Can I choose some colour schemes or themes for the whole site which changes the colour of the backgrounds and the strokes. Maybe like 5 cool themes, and a light and dark mode button which is remembered locally on both web and mobile web"

6. Final Refinements:
"The stroke arrows are not quite correct order, and also they are over the drawing, can you make them just small indicators that don't cover the character I want to draw at all.
Can you create a file called prompts.txt with all the prompts I gave you
Can you make the drawing canvas darker in dark mode too please. Don't want my eyes to hurt at night
The navigating to the next character automatically when drawn close enough does not seem to be working"
